# react-hierarchy-tree

Use react to create a hierarchical tree editable objects.  The tree itself may be edited and rearranged in an intuitive way without lifting your hand from the keyboard, however, you can use the mouse to drag tree nodes around.

As each node is selected, a corresponding form for that object type is displayed to the right.  Usually this form allows rich text editing using Draft.js.
